## Quiz Application  

We initially built a **Quiz Application** using a **Monolithic Architecture**. 
Later, we improved it by implementing a **Microservices Architecture**, which consists of:  

- **Quiz Service**: Handles quiz-related functionalities.  
- **Question Service**: Manages quiz questions.  
- **Service Registry**: Enables service discovery.  
- **API Gateway**: Routes and secures requests.  

This transition helps in better scalability, maintainability, and performance.
